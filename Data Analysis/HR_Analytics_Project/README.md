## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, encoded categorical variables 
3. **EDA in Python** – visualized salary distribution, turnover rate by age & tenure  
4. **Power BI Dashboard** – built KPIs for:
   - Attrition Rate %  
   - Average Salary by Department  
   - Overtime vs Attrition  
   - Gender & Age breakdowns
